This tool is intended for debugging and learning purposes.

It shows the data which is stored in the HBase row of a record. It is not
a generic HBase tool but displays the data in a way that make sense for Lily,
and shows the various cell values in a decoded way.

Nonetheless, the tool shows all versions for each column, even if we know
Lily only store one, to be able to detect unexpected situations or version
numbers. It also shows the names of unexpected columns and column families.

Tip: to render the HTML on the command line, you can use something like this:

lily-record-row | w3m -T text/html -dump -cols 120
