To use this tool:
 1. Dump a sample configuration to a file:
    lily-tester -d > config.json
 2. Customize config.json
 3. Run the test:
    lily-tester -c config.json

Tester keeps all created records in memory, in order to be able to later check
the result of read operations, or to be able to update existing records.

Tester runs only one thread. To do multi-threaded testing, run multiple instances.

Logging is performed to two files: one containing a line per CRUD operation,
with its duration and success state. Another file contains the stacktraces of
errors that occurred.

Besides the produced log files, you can also monitor the execution through
JMX and optionally Ganglia.
