mbox files
----------
mbox files are both accepted in plain format or gzip format (.gz).
When specifying a directory, all files in the directory will be
imported.

mbox files of public mailing lists can be found on the Internet, for example
those of Hadoop: http://hadoop.apache.org/mail/

About schema creation
---------------------
The schema is always created or updated when importing some mbox archives.
Using the --schema option, you can also create the schema without importing
anything, which is useful if your first want to set up an index.

About metrics
-------------
By default you can consult metrics via JMX.

Metrics can also be sent to Ganglia by creating a property file and passing it
via the --metrics option. Here is an example file:

recordName=mbox1
mbox.class=org.apache.hadoop.metrics.ganglia.GangliaContext31
mbox.period=15
mbox.servers=localhost:8649
