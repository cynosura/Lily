mbox files
----------
mbox files are both accepted in plain format or gzip format (.gz).
When specifying a directory, all files in the directory will be
imported.

mbox files of public mailing lists can be found on the Internet, for example
those of Hadoop: http://hadoop.apache.org/mail/

About schema creation
---------------------
The schema is always created or updated when importing some mbox archives.
Using the --schema option, you can also create the schema without importing
anything, which is useful if your first want to set up an index.
