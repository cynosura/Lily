  <!-- The WAL or MQ processor is a component which is active on one of the Lily servers,
       elected through ZooKeeper. The processor is responsible for continuing interrupted
       secondary actions (in case of the WAL) or distributing messages to listeners (in
       case of the MQ). By setting the enabled flag to false, this Lily instance will
       not be a candidate to run the WAL or MQ processor. If they are disabled on all
       Lily servers, no processing at all will happen. -->

  <!-- linkIndexUpdater: if enabled, the wal-rowlog subscription will be made if necessary, if false,
       the subscription will be removed if present (effectively disabling updating of the
       link index). This setting should be the same on all your Lily nodes. -->
  <linkIndexUpdater enabled="true"/>

  <!-- mqFeeder: similar to linkIndexUpdater (adds/remove the wal-rowlog subscription).
       If disabled, the message queue will not be fed with messages.
