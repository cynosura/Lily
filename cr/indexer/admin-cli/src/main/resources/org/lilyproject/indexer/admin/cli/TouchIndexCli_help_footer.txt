Touching an index will trigger any components that listen to changes in the
index configurations.

This can be useful if in the original trigger, a component failed for some
reason, and that reason is meanwhile resolved. For example, an indexer
worker failed to start the index updaters because some field types referred
in the indexer configuration did not exist. If they have meanwhile been
created, you can touch the index.
